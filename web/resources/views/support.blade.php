  <p><strong>Kweh!</strong> is built and maintained by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/40945/" target="_blank">Boki Toki of Tonberry</a> as a hobby and an excuse to fuel his addiction to Final Fantasy.</p>

  <p>It is free to use for the community and there isn't any plan to monetize or gate features behind a paywall.</p>

  <p>Monetary support via Patreon is entirely optional and will be used to cover the server and bandwidth cost required to keep the bot running 24/7. Excess will be used to upgrade the existing infrastructure that <strong>Kweh!</strong> is on so it can run both more stable and faster.</p>

  <p><small>And, probably on tea to accompany late night programming sessions â˜•</small></p>
